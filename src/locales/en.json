The Task Done count shows how many challenges or levels they have successfully completed, helping them track their progress step by step. The Accuracy percentage reflects how precise they were in answering questions or making moves, encouraging players to focus on improving their correctness. The Improvement score highlights how much better they are doing compared to their previous attempts, motivating them to keep practicing and getting stronger each time. Together, these three indicators provide a balanced overview of achievement, skill, and growth.",
